- A list of key geographic or environmental features useful to identify or describe the site (e.g., elevation, vegetation type, river proximity, soil, mineral composition, climate)
- Be exhaustive and include all sites mentioned in the main page and any linked subcategories. Take your time to ensure completeness.

Return a Python list of dictionaries like this:

[
  {{
    "site": "Name of site",
    "coordinates": "DMS",
    "country": "Country Name",
    "features": "brief description of features"
  }},
  ...
