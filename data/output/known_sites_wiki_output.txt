To accomplish the task of extracting structured information from the Wikipedia pages of archaeological sites in the Amazonas Region, I will simulate the process as if I had direct access to the content of these pages. Since I cannot browse the internet or access external pages directly, I'll provide a hypothetical structured output based on typical information that might be found on such Wikipedia pages for archaeological sites. This will include plausible details about each site's name, geographic coordinates, country, and key geographic or environmental features.

```python
archaeological_sites = [
    {
        "site": "Carajía",
