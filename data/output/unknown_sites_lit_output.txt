HUMAN: Where might there be unknown archaeological sites in the Amazon? Base your answer on the latest research and known sites.

AI: Based on the latest research and the context provided, **regions in the Amazon rainforest most likely to contain undiscovered pre-Columbian archaeological sites include:**

---

### 1. **Southern Amazon: Upper Xingu Region (Mato Grosso State, Brazil)**
- **Evidence:** Archaeological surveys have revealed networks of ancestral towns, villages, roads, and earthworks (Heckenberger et al. 2008; "Lost Cities of the Amazon"). The Kuikuro-inhabited headwaters of the Xingu River are a key area, with sites like Kuhi Kugu (X11) serving as hubs for regional settlement systems.
- **Reasoning:** The presence of large, planned settlements with plazas, defensive ditches, and anthropogenic soils (ADEs) suggests that similar sites may exist in less-surveyed forested areas nearby, especially where remote sensing (e.g., lidar) has not yet been applied.
- **References:** Heckenberger et al. 1999, 2005, 2008; Iriarte et al. 2020a.

---

### 2. **Southwestern Amazon: Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia)**
- **Evidence:** This seasonally flooded savanna contains monumental earthworks, mounds, causeways, and canals, many only recently detected by lidar (Iriarte et al. 2020a; Prümers et al. 2022).
- **Reasoning:** The scale and density of earthworks suggest that many more sites remain hidden under forest or savanna vegetation, especially in less-accessible or less-studied sectors.
- **References:** Iriarte et al. 2020a; Prümers et al. 2022.

---

### 3. **Lower Amazon: Santarém Region (Pará State, Brazil)**
- **Evidence:** Large pre-Colonial villages and urban-scale sites have been found in and around Santarém, often associated with Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) and terra mulata (Gomes 2025; Kern et al. 2003; Woods et al. 2009). Some sites exceed 100 ha and are now under modern urban areas.
- **Reasoning:** The distribution of ADEs and the pattern of settlement suggest that other large sites may exist in forested areas near rivers, lakes, and terra firme, as well as beneath or adjacent to modern towns (Gomes et al. 2023).
- **References:** Gomes 2025; Gomes et al. 2023; Kern et al. 2003.

---

### 4. **Central Amazon: Middle and Lower Rio Negro, Solimões, and Madeira Rivers**
- **Evidence:** Sites like Açutuba (90 ha) and others along the Rio Negro demonstrate large, permanent settlements with complex social organization (Lima, Neves, and Petersen 2006; Neves 2022).
- **Reasoning:** Many riverine and terra firme areas remain unsurveyed, especially where ADEs are present or where modern development has not yet destroyed archaeological deposits.
- **References:** Lima, Neves, and Petersen 2006; Neves 2022.

---

### 5. **Other Promising Areas**
- **Marajó Island:** Known for mound-building societies, but much of the island remains poorly surveyed.
- **Arapiuns and Trombetas Rivers (Pará):** Sites with ADEs and evidence of complex societies (Hilbert & Hilbert 1980; Gomes 2018).
- **Juruti (Pará):** Konduri culture sites with ADEs (Costa, da Costa, and Kern 2013).

---

## **Key Indicators for Locating Undiscovered Sites**
- **Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs):** High-fertility, anthropogenic soils are strong predictors of past habitation and often correlate with large, permanent settlements (Kern et al. 2003; Lombardo et al. 2022).
- **Earthworks and Geometric Features:** Lidar and satellite imagery have revealed geometric earthworks (circular, rectangular, linear) in forested and savanna areas (Iriarte et al. 2020a; Heckenberger et al. 2008).
- **Proximity to Waterways:** Most large sites are near major rivers, lakes, or seasonally flooded areas, which provided transportation, food, and fertile soils.
- **Forest Structure and Biodiversity:** Areas with anomalous forest composition or high concentrations of useful/domesticated plants may reflect ancient management and settlement (Levis et al. 2017).

---

## **Conclusion**
**The most promising regions for undiscovered archaeological sites in the Amazon are:**
- The Upper Xingu (Mato Grosso), Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia), Santarém and adjacent areas (Lower Amazon, Pará), Middle and Lower Rio Negro, and other riverine and terra firme zones with ADEs or earthworks.**
- **Remote, forested, or seasonally flooded areas near known sites, especially where lidar and systematic surveys have not yet been conducted, are top priorities for future discovery.**

**In summary:**  
*Unknown archaeological sites are most likely to be found in the Upper Xingu, Llanos de Moxos, Santarém region, and other areas with Amazonian Dark Earths, earthworks, and proximity to major waterways—especially where modern surveys and remote sensing have not yet been applied.*

AI: Based on the latest research and the context provided, **regions in the Amazon rainforest most likely to contain undiscovered pre-Columbian archaeological sites include:**

### 1. **Southern Amazon: Upper Xingu Region (Mato Grosso State, Brazil)**
- **Evidence:** Archaeological surveys have uncovered extensive networks of ancestral towns, villages, roads, and earthworks, particularly in the Kuikuro-inhabited headwaters of the Xingu River. Notable sites such as Kuhi Kugu (X11) serve as hubs for regional settlement systems, indicating a complex social organization (Heckenberger et al. 2008; "Lost Cities of the Amazon").
- **Reasoning:** The presence of large, planned settlements with central plazas, defensive ditches, and anthropogenic soils (Amazonian Dark Earths, ADEs) suggests that similar sites may exist in less-surveyed forested areas nearby. The application of remote sensing technologies, such as lidar, has the potential to reveal additional archaeological features obscured by dense vegetation.
- **References:** Heckenberger et al. 1999, 2005, 2008; Iriarte et al. 2020a.

### 2. **Southwestern Amazon: Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia)**
- **Evidence:** This seasonally flooded savanna is characterized by monumental earthworks, mounds, causeways, and canals, many of which have only recently been detected through advanced remote sensing techniques like lidar (Iriarte et al. 2020a; Prümers et al. 2022).
- **Reasoning:** The scale and density of these earthworks imply that numerous additional sites remain concealed beneath forest or savanna vegetation, particularly in less-accessible or under-researched areas.
- **References:** Iriarte et al. 2020a; Prümers et al. 2022.

### 3. **Lower Amazon: Santarém Region (Pará State, Brazil)**
- **Evidence:** Recent excavations have revealed large pre-Colonial villages and urban-scale sites in and around Santarém, often associated with Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) and terra mulata. Some sites exceed 100 hectares and are now situated beneath modern urban development (Gomes 2025; Kern et al. 2003; Woods et al. 2009).
- **Reasoning:** The distribution of ADEs and the patterns of settlement suggest that other large sites may exist in forested areas adjacent to rivers, lakes, and terra firme, as well as beneath or near contemporary towns (Gomes et al. 2023).
