HUMAN: Where might there be unknown archaeological sites in the Amazon?

AI: **Based on the provided context and current scientific understanding, the most likely regions in the Amazon rainforest to contain undiscovered pre-Columbian archaeological sites are:**

---

### 1. **Bridging Areas of the Southern Rim of Amazonia (SRA), Especially the Upper Tapajós Basin (UTB) and Adjacent Transitional Forests**

#### **Evidence & Reasoning:**
- **Recent Discoveries:** The Upper Tapajós Basin (UTB) was long considered an archaeological gap, but recent surveys have uncovered 81 new sites with 104 earthworks, demonstrating that earthwork sites are distributed continuously along an 1800 km east–west corridor in the SRA (see Nature Communications, 2018).
- **Landscape Preferences:** Sites are typically found on relatively flat landscapes with gentle hills, at elevations of 100–300 m, especially on small plateaus overlooking rivers and streams.
- **Ethnohistoric Accounts:** 18th-century sources describe the UTB as densely populated, with large villages and straight, wide roads, suggesting more sites remain to be found.
- **Settlement Patterns:** The presence of both small and large ditched enclosures, often in compounds, and the association with Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) indicates long-term, intensive occupation.
- **Scientific Reference:** “If true, this connection would suggest an uninterrupted distribution of earthworks along 1800 km east–west in the SRA and a more intense Pre-Columbian human impact in the forests of this region than previously postulated.” (Nature Communications, 2018)

#### **Implication:**
**Transitional forests and interfluvial plateaus between major rivers (e.g., between the Juruena, Aripuanã, and Teles Pires rivers) are highly likely to contain further undiscovered sites, especially where remote sensing and fieldwork have not yet been conducted.**

---

### 2. **Lower Amazon, Especially Urban and Peri-Urban Areas (e.g., Santarém Region)**

#### **Evidence & Reasoning:**
- **Large Urban Complexes:** Recent urban archaeology in Santarém has revealed massive pre-Colonial villages (Aldeia and Porto sites, 121 ha and 89 ha, respectively) beneath modern city infrastructure (Gomes, 2025).
- **Settlement Hierarchies:** The region shows evidence of complex, large-scale settlements with ceremonial centers, suggesting that similar sites may exist under other urban or peri-urban areas, currently obscured by modern development.
- **Historical Accounts:** Early European explorers described large settlements in this region, supporting the likelihood of further undiscovered sites.
- **Scientific Reference:** “The Aldeia and Porto pre-colonial sites, located in the urban area of Santarém city, Brazil, are of singular importance… The largest archaeological complex found today in any urban area of Amazonia.” (Gomes, 2025)

#### **Implication:**
**Other urbanized or partially urbanized areas along major river confluences (especially the Amazon and Tapajós) may conceal significant archaeological remains, detectable with geophysical or remote sensing methods.**

---

### 3. **Southwestern Amazonia: Llanos de Mojos and Adjacent Forest-Savannah Mosaics (Bolivia and Brazil Borderlands)**

#### **Evidence & Reasoning:**
- **Lidar Discoveries:** In the Llanos de Mojos, lidar has revealed extensive low-density urbanism of the Casarabe culture, including large settlements (up to 315 ha), causeways, canals, and monumental architecture (Nature, 2022).
- **Settlement System:** The Casarabe culture area (ca. 4,500 km²) is only partially mapped; lidar surveys have already increased the known number of sites, suggesting many more remain undiscovered beneath forest cover.
- **Environmental Setting:** Sites are preferentially located on slightly elevated, well-drained soils within seasonally flooded savannah–forest mosaics, especially where Andean-derived sediments create favorable agricultural conditions.
- **Scientific Reference:** “Despite these important advances… our understanding of the civic-ceremonial architecture of the major sites and the regional organization of the Casarabe-culture settlements has remained poorly understood… The new data allowed us to define a four-tiered hierarchy classification of sites…” (Nature, 2022)

#### **Implication:**
**Unsurveyed elevated areas within the Llanos de Mojos and similar forest-savannah mosaics are prime candidates for further discoveries, especially using lidar and remote sensing.**

## **Summary Table: High-Potential Regions for Undiscovered Amazonian Archaeological Sites**

| Region/Area                        | Environmental Setting         | Archaeological Potential & Rationale                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Upper Tapajós Basin & SRA bridging areas | Transitional forests, plateaus | Recent discoveries fill previous gaps; ethnohistoric evidence of dense populations; continuous earthwork distribution |
| Lower Amazon (e.g., Santarém)       | Urban/peri-urban, river confluence | Large sites found under cities; historical accounts; likely more sites under modern development                       |
| Llanos de Mojos (Bolivia, SW Amazon) | Forest-savannah mosaic, elevated soils | Lidar reveals extensive urbanism; many areas unsurveyed; favorable soils and topography                               |

## **Conclusion**

**The most promising areas for finding unknown archaeological sites in the Amazon are:**
- **Transitional forests and plateaus between major southern Amazonian rivers (especially the Upper Tapajós Basin and SRA bridging areas)**
- **Urban and peri-urban zones along the Lower Amazon (notably around Santarém and similar river confluences)**
- **Elevated, well-drained areas within the Llanos de Mojos and other forest-savannah mosaics of southwestern Amazonia**

**These regions combine favorable environmental settings, ethnohistoric and archaeological evidence of past dense populations, and recent discoveries that suggest many sites remain undetected, especially where modern technology (e.g., lidar, remote sensing) has not yet been applied.**

### 1. **Bridging Areas of the Southern Rim of Amazonia (SRA), Particularly the Upper Tapajós Basin (UTB) and Adjacent Transitional Forests**

#### **Evidence & Reasoning:**
- **Recent Discoveries:** The Upper Tapajós Basin (UTB) has been identified as a significant archaeological area, previously overlooked, where recent surveys have revealed 81 new sites and a total of 104 earthworks. This finding indicates a continuous distribution of earthworks along an 1800 km east-west corridor in the SRA, challenging previous assumptions about the scale of Pre-Columbian human impact in this region (Nature Communications, 2018).
- **Landscape Preferences:** The surveyed sites are predominantly located on relatively flat landscapes with gentle hills, at elevations between 100–300 m, particularly on small plateaus that overlook rivers and streams. This topographical preference suggests that similar undetected sites may exist in comparable landscapes.
- **Ethnohistoric Accounts:** Historical accounts from the 18th century describe the UTB as densely populated, with large villages connected by straight, wide roads, indicating a complex settlement pattern that warrants further investigation.
- **Settlement Patterns:** The presence of both small and large ditched enclosures, often forming compounds, along with the association with Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE), suggests long-term, intensive human occupation and landscape modification.
- **Scientific Reference:** “If true, this connection would suggest an uninterrupted distribution of earthworks along 1800 km east-west in the SRA and a more intense Pre-Columbian human impact in the forests of this region than previously postulated.” (Nature Communications, 2018)

### 2. **Lower Amazon, Particularly Urban and Peri-Urban Areas (e.g., Santarém Region)**

#### **Evidence & Reasoning:**
- **Large Urban Complexes:** Recent urban archaeological investigations in Santarém have uncovered substantial pre-Columbian villages (Aldeia and Porto sites, measuring 121 ha and 89 ha, respectively) beneath modern urban infrastructure (Gomes, 2025). This indicates that significant archaeological remains may be hidden under urbanized areas.
- **Settlement Hierarchies:** The evidence of complex, large-scale settlements with ceremonial centers suggests that similar sites may exist beneath other urban or peri-urban areas, currently obscured by modern development.
- **Historical Accounts:** Early European explorers documented large indigenous settlements in this region, reinforcing the likelihood of further undiscovered sites.
- **Scientific Reference:** “The Aldeia and Porto pre-colonial sites, located in the urban area of Santarém city, Brazil, are of singular importance… The largest archaeological complex found today in any urban area of Amazonia.” (Gomes, 2025)

#### **Implication:**
**Other urbanized or partially urbanized areas along major river confluences (especially the Amazon and Tapajós) may conceal significant archaeological remains, which could be detected using geophysical or remote sensing methods.**

### 3. **Southwestern Amazonia: Llanos de Mojos and Adjacent Forest-Savannah Mosaics (Bolivia and Brazil Borderlands)**

#### **Evidence & Reasoning:**
- **Lidar Discoveries:** In the Llanos de Mojos, lidar technology has revealed extensive low-density urbanism associated with the Casarabe culture, including large settlements (up to 315 ha), causeways, canals, and monumental architecture (Nature, 2022). This suggests a complex settlement system that has not been fully documented.
- **Settlement System:** The Casarabe culture area spans approximately 4,500 km², and the recent lidar surveys have significantly increased the known number of sites, indicating that many more remain undiscovered beneath forest cover.
- **Environmental Setting:** Sites are preferentially located on slightly elevated, well-drained soils within seasonally flooded savannah–forest mosaics, particularly where Andean-derived sediments create favorable agricultural conditions.
- **Scientific Reference:** “Despite these important advances… our understanding of the civic-ceremonial architecture of the major sites and the regional organization of the Casarabe-culture settlements has remained poorly understood… The new data allowed us to define a four-tiered hierarchy classification of sites…” (Nature, 2022)
